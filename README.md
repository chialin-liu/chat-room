Create a chat application for users to chat using NodeJS and Socket.IO
1. Users can view how many people are in the chat room
2. If new users get into the specific chat room, people will be notified by their appearance
3. The chat room will block foul words
4. People can share their location to the chat room
5. The scrollbar will automatically scroll down if the messages show up
